<div class="texto4">
  <p>Former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark defined Canadian cuisine as "a cuisine of many cuisines" since the country has an immense variety of typical dishes with diverse cultural influences.</p>
  <p>However, considering that Canadian roots lie in French, English, and Indigenous culture, it is from this blend that its main flavors emerge.</p>
  <p>Let's get to know some classic recipes:</p>
  <p>Poutine</p>
  <p>Poutine is the most traditional dish in Canada, created in Quebec and consumed throughout the country.</p>
  <p>The recipe consists of basically french fries topped with cheddar cheese curds and covered in special meat gravy.</p>
  <p>Beaver Tail (Rabo de Castor)</p>
  <p>The famous "beaver tail" is a highly caloric treat made with fried dough and topped with Nutella, chocolate, or peanut butter.</p>
  <p>The name comes from its resemblance to the rodent's tail, and the sweet treat can be topped with any desired topping.</p>
